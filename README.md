## Custom Indicator

The code includes a custom indicator that is used to identify buy and sell signals. This indicator is calculated using an adaptive smart algorithm to filter out consolidation zones and market noise. The buy and sell signals are then determined based on the analysis of the indicator values.

## Trading Logic

The trading logic of this robot is implemented in the `start()` function. It follows these steps:

1. Calculate the indicator values using the adaptive smart algorithm.
2. Filter out consolidation zones and market noise.
3. Check for buy and sell signals based on the indicator's analysis.
4. Place buy and sell arrows on the chart.
5. Implement proper money management.
6. Return a logical conclusion of the trading decision.

## Buy and Sell Signals

The buy and sell signals are determined by the `CheckBuySignal()` and `CheckSellSignal()` functions, respectively. These functions implement the logic to check for the respective signals. Modify the line `return (false);` in each function to return `true` if a buy or sell signal is found.

## Opening Trades

The `OpenBuyTrade()` and `OpenSellTrade()` functions are responsible for opening buy and sell trades, respectively. They implement the logic to open the trades using the `lotSize`, `stopLoss`, and `takeProfit` parameters. After opening a trade, a message is printed to the Experts tab.
